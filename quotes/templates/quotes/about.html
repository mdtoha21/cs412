<h2>About Albert Einstein</h2>

<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: left; padding: 20px;">
    <p>
        <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> (March 14, 1879 – April 18, 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist 
        who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He is best known for 
        developing the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc², which arises from relativity theory, has been called 
        "the world's most famous equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. 
        He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for 
        his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.

        Beyond his scientific achievements, Einstein was known for his profound wisdom and philosophical insights, 
        often expressed through memorable quotes about life, imagination, knowledge, and the nature of reality.
